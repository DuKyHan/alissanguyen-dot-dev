Indeed, focusing on work is one way to achieve our goals but in order to maintain your health and mental, relaxation is the key to restore the energy throughout the day and to balance our daily life.</p> </div> <div class="post-section-image-container"> <figure class="post-section-figure"><img class="post-section-image" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HWikyAj1FSZ2UcW8VAtIapMZv_c=/0x0:1800x1200/1200x800/filters:focal(753x0:1041x288)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69047461/headshots_1617069529743.0.jpg" alt="" /> <figcaption class="post-section-image-figcaption"><em class="post-section-image-description">"Hard work" is the advice from these successful people, but they don't often talk about other healthy habits that also help them along the way. </em></figcaption> </figure> </div> <div class="post-section"> <p class="post-paragraph">It is helpful to take breaks once in a while yet so many of us stumble upon procrastination. We cover our laziness and unproductiveness with the coat of 'relaxation' and ignore our failing spiral. Ask yourself these questions:<em class="post-italic"> "Have I done anything helpful today?", "Am I I taking care of myself fully and healthily?", "Should I really be playing video games right now or doing something else that will make me happier in the future?".</em> If you answer <mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color: #c1f5f5;">'No'</mark> to any of these questions, then welcome to our concept for today: <strong><mark class="post-bold has-inline-color" style="background-color: #ffff7b;">Toxic relaxation.</mark></strong></p> </div> <div class="post-section-image-container"> <figure class="post-section-figure"><img class="post-section-image" src="https://thecreativelife.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/shutterstock_601623479.png" alt="" width="517" height="517" /> <figcaption class="post-section-image-figcaption"><em class="post-section-image-description">Asking yourself questions about life goals and responsibilities will help you find out what you are doing wrong.</em></figcaption> </figure> </div> <div class="post-section"> <p class="post-paragraph">We don't usually associate 'relaxing' with 'toxicity'. Why should we? Relaxing feels so goooood~ and it also helps reducing depression and stress so it should be helping me already, right? <strong class="post-bold"><em class="post-italic"><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color: #ffbebe;">NOPE.</mark></em></strong> Instead, it could be doing the opposite. You are spending all day laying in bed, not taking a shower, not doing laundry, not cleaning your room, not learning anything new, and not having anything done. In short, you are not taking care of yourself. And chances are, you are not happy about your "relaxation" and yourself as you are doing your "relaxation". As a result of these behaviors, you feel like <em class="post-italic">a</em> <em class="post-italic">potato</em>, you feel like a<em class="post-italic"> parasite of society</em>, you feel <em class="post-italic">guilty for existing</em> and you <strong class="post-bold"><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color: #fdceb2;">panic</mark></strong>. Welp, panicking is not going to help you either. Panic causes more stress, and excuses: "I will get it done tomorrow", "What could be harmful if I take another 3-hour break?" "I will get up when I feel better"... Consequently, <strong class="post-bold"><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color: #d8ffff;">procrastination</mark></strong>. So, is your 'relaxing' helpful? No, it is <strong>toxic.</strong> So how do we identify <strong class="post-bold">"toxic relaxation"?</strong> Well, if you are spiraling down a cycle of guilt and excuses (like the picture above), then you are doing toxic relaxation.</p> </div> <div class="post-section-image-container"> <figure class="post-section-figure"><img class="post-section-image" src="https://procrastination.com/assets/frontend/img/procrastination-circles.svg" alt="" width="564" height="416" /> <figcaption class="post-section-image-figcaption">Image Credit: <a class="post-caption-image-description-a" href="https://procrastination.com/what-is-procrastination" data-type="URL" data-id="https://procrastination.com/what-is-procrastination">https://procrastination.com/what-is-procrastination</a></figcaption> </figure> </div> <div class="post-section"> <p class="post-paragraph">It is no stranger to us that relaxation is important, yet schools don't teach you how to relax the <strong class="post-bold"><mark class="has-inline-color" style="background-color: #fafd73;">right way</mark></strong>.
